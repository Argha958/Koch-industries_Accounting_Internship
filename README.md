# Koch-industries_Accounting_Internship 
Consumer Products Division

During my virtual internship with Koch Industries, I gained hands-on experience in supporting senior leadership within the Consumer Products division at Georgia-Pacific. Key tasks included:

Strategic Financial Support: Collaborated with Mark Saigon, VP of Consumer Product Sales, by providing relevant financial insights to aid in strategic decision-making.

SG&A Cost Analysis: Conducted a thorough analysis of SG&A (Selling, General & Administrative) expenses, identifying drivers of increased costs over the previous quarter. I effectively communicated findings to bridge the understanding gap among stakeholders, enhancing department responsiveness and alignment with leadership expectations.

This experience refined my ability to present financial data concisely, reinforcing the importance of clarity and precision in financial reporting and strategic advisement.
